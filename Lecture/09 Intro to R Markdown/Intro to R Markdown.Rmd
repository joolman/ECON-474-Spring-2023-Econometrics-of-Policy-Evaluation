# Markdown Basics
*********************************************

Markdown is an easy-to-read text formatting language that converts plain text into a pretty document.
R Markdown is R's version of Markdown that can incorporate, execute, and output R code in the final "knitted" document.
To knit the document type `Ctrl_Shift-K`

## Writing Text
************************************************

This is how to write in Markdown.
Notice writing on the next line of code stays in the same paragraph.

This is how to start a new paragraph.

Wrap your words in \* to get *italics*.
Using two \*s will produce **boldface**.
You can combine \_ in any order to get *__boldfaced italics__*.

There are other things we can do too, like making lists.

1. Item 1
2. Item two
    b. notice we had to press tab twice
        - You can choose whether you use numbers of letters, but R Markdown chooses symbols for you :'(
        
This is how we type inline code like `R`'s base function `plot()`, which is not as pretty as `ggplot2`'s `ggplot()`.

## Manual Tables
*********************************************

| Region | GDP | Unemployment Rate |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Narnia | 10 | 5 |
| Hogwarts | ? | -42 |

| Region | GDP | Unemployment Rate |
| ---: | :--- | :---: |
| Narnia | 10 | 5 |
| Hogwarts | ? | -42 |

| Region     | GDP | Unemployment Rate |
|------------|-----|------------------:|
| **Narnia** | 10  |                 5 |
| Hogwarts   | _?_ |               -42 |

## LaTeX Math Integration
***********************************

To write math, we can use some *limited* $\LaTeX$ features.
Like if  we wanted to show a regression formula inline: 
$y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$.
Alternatively, if we have some important math, we can make it stand out:
$$
2 + 2 = 2\times 2 = 2^2 = 4 \approx \pi
$$
OR, if we really want to show off knowing the geometric series identity, we can show it by `align`ing it with \&:
$$
\begin{align}
  \sum_{n=0}^\infty ar^n &= a \left(  \frac{1}{1-r}  \right)  \tag{1.1} \\
  & = \frac{a}{1-r}\\
  & \text{for } |r| < 1
\end{align}
$$


## Including Links
****************************************

If we want to link sections, we do so like this [Section 1].
Or if we need to link a website, we do this while making sure to include the https.

A really useful [resource](https:/www.bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown) for additional R Markdown tips and tricks.


## Including Images
*************************************

This is how we include images in our Markdown.
![XKCD is the best](linear_regression_2x.png)


## Writing Code
*******************************************

Here is the basics to writing code chunks.
```{r hello}
print('hello world')
```
The first part of the curly braces tells you what language to use and the name of the code chunk.
Then there are options, which can be set up after a comma and setting them to either `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
Some of the major options are:

- `include` - Whether or not to be included in the document
- `echo` - Display the code
- `results` - Displays the output of the code
- `messages` - Displays messages from the functions (if they have them)


Be careful when working inside of the .Rmd:
```{r caution1}
set.seed(474)

df = data.frame(x = 1:5,
                y = runif(5))
df

```

```{r caution 2}
df$y = df$y + 1
df$z = c("a", "new", "column", "of", "strings")

summary(df)
```

Another issue that people come across is closing the document to continue working on the assignment later.


```{r, eval = FALSE}
# If you want to include a code chunk that is not run you can do so with eval = FALSE

print(b) # produces an error
```

# **[34 points]** An Example Assignment 
****************************

You are going to use the Gapminder data in 2007 to produce three sets of summary statistics and produce a figure.

## **[16 points]** Load in ggplot2 and Gapminder
**********************************************

1. **[10 points]** load in `ggplot2` and **omit your code**.
2. **[6 points]** load in gapminder as `gm`

```{r preliminary, include = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

gm = read.csv('C:/Users/johnj/Dropbox/Julian/Academia/UIUC/Semester 12 Spring 2023/ECON474sp23/Data/DwD1 gapminder.csv')
```

Done! but I am not going to show you!

## **[points]** Produce three summary stastics
*******************************************

1. **[7 points]** produce a correlation matrix

```{r cor mat}

cor(gm[ , c("gdpPercap_2007", "lifeExp_2007", "pop_2007")])
```

2. **[$\pi$ points]** obtain the mean and standard deviation of the **America's** GDPc

```{r m sd americas}
americas = gm[gm$continent == 'Americas', ]
m = mean(americas$gdpPercap_2007)
sd = sd(americas$gdpPercap_2007)

print(paste("America's Average GDPc in 2007:", round(m, 2),
            "\nAmerica's SD GDPc in 2007:", round(sd, 2)))
```

3. **[-45 points]** print summary statistics of life expectancy for countries with GDPc less than $10,000.

```{r sumstat}

```

## Plot replication
****************************

- **[5 points]** Replicate the final Gapminder plot from DwD1 section 2

```{r replication}
ggplot(gm, aes(x = log(gdpPercap_2007), y = lifeExp_2007,
               color = continent, size = pop_2007)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  scale_size_continuous(guide = 'none') +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = 'log(GDP per Capita)', y = 'Life Expectancy', #######################
       title = 'GDPc vs. Life Expectancy 2007',
       color = 'Continent') +
  theme(text = element_text(size = 20)) +
  geom_text(aes(label = ifelse(pop_2007 >= quantile(pop_2007, 0.90),
                               country, # TRUE
                               '')),    # FALSE
            size = 5, hjust = 0, vjust = 0, nudge_x = .1) +
  xlim(NA, 11.7)
```
