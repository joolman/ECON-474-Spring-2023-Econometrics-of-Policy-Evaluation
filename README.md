# ECON-474-Spring-2023-Econometrics-of-Policy-Evaluation

This repository contains the materials I created for my Econometrics of Policy Evaluation Course (ECON 474 Spring 2023). The course is based around learning a variety of causal inference techniques and applying them by replicating several academic papers. The techniques were taught in R.

Data sets are not provided but most can be obtained from article replication files.
